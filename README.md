This is my first Unity game, where I have learned the basics of Unity development. Throughout the process of creating this game, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience in Unity's functionalities and features.

In this game, the player have the ability to pick up and use some tools. An axe is required to gather wood from trees, while a pickaxe is required to mine stones. Collected items are stored in the player's inventory. The player also can build a house, which provides additional resources.
