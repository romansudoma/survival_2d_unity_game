This is my first Unity game, where I have learned the basics of Unity development. Throughout the process of creating this game, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience in Unity's functionalities and features.

In this game, the player can pick up instruments and use it. An axe needed to loot a tree, a pick axe needed to loot a stone. Every item puted in an inventory. The player also can build a house, which gives some resources.
